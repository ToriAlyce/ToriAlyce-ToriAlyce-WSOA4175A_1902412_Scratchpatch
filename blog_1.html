        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Analysis of Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. article On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis</h2>
        <p style="font: size 1rem;">
            In this critical analysis, I will be analysing Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. article On Decoloniality: Concepts, Analytics, Praxis. 
            I found this article very interesting as it is not trying to define decolonization or provide ways in which we can liberate ourselves 
            from America’s colonial rule. Instead, Mignolo and Walsh discuss the necessity of implementing decolonisation and why it has affected 
            the globe in terms of dictating the norms and standards for the world.  
        </p>
        <p>
            What Mignolo and Walsh are trying to do is focus on Relationality and how we as a society can integrate the ideas and thoughts 
            passed to us through decolonization and merge our own world perspectives, ideas, and thoughts. This is what I find so 
            interesting about the reading as I personally believe this is the best way forward in terms of gaining global knowledge 
            and not following a set standard by one global power. It is extremely obvious of the racist, sexist and cultural ideas 
            that we are trying to separate from in decolonization but now it is time to focus on relationality and how we as humans 
            need to rationalize our thinking and incorporate more layers of thought and idea from all across the globe. I believe that 
            the Global North does have a fair amount of understanding and ideas that are beneficial to society, however, I believe that 
            across the world there are so many more diverse races, cultures, and ways of thinking that are important and some curtail
             that are just being overlooked and by the Global North and that is what we need to focus on changing. We need to incorporate 
             all ideas and views in order to see the full picture of the state our world and society are in.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of relationality Mignolo and Walsh do not mean that there is only one way to do or conceive decoloniality, 
            relationality also does not mean to just include other practices and concepts into our own. It means to reference all 
            the global thoughts, ideas, practices, and concepts, integrating them all to greater in a way that benefits everyone 
            and promotes the common good for society.
        </p>

            “The aim of the series is to make accessible —through short, single- and/or coauthored  texts,  and  edited  
            collections— reflections  on  decoloniality  from  diferent continents, territories, and geographies; from diferent 
            geobody sto-rytellings,  histories,  herstories,  and  transtories;  and  from  diferent  translo-cal subjectivities, 
            struggles, worldviews, and world senses, most especially of those who have lived—and live—the colonial diference.” <br>
            (Mignolo. Walsh, 2018)
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, I really enjoyed the concept of relationality that Mignolo, W D. and Walsh, C E. (2018) have discussed. 
            I believe relationality is the best way to put colonial rule behind us and start to grow as a global society together 
            instead of against each other and if we could all try incorporating relationality in our decolonization practices society 
            would reap a great benefit in expanding all knowledge.
