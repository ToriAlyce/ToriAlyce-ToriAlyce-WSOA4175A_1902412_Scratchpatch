        <p>
            For this website, I wanted to bring in the concept of how vast the internet is and how many layers there are 
            to go through. So the best kind of design I could think of was to include this was an idea of a scratch patch 
            website that reveals more content as you scratch it away so that the user can experience an idea of many layers 
            of the internet I am trying to represent in my website. I feel as though this is the best feature in my website 
            as the user also gets a special kind of interactivity as they uncover the layers to my site.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest thing I struggled with was creating the overall layout and UI and UX design for my site. In the first 
            design, I wanted to only have one page to the site that the user has to then erase through each layer of the site 
            and view the website that way. However, I struggled a lot when it came to the overall code of this as the user 
            currently is only able to scratch away one top layer. I also felt as though this idea was way too linear and that 
            the user should still feel as though they are on a website and be able to navigate to the pages they want or interact 
            with the scratch feature. This allows them more choice when the user interacts with the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore I finally decided on the current layout of my site, which allows much friendlier usability for the user as 
            they interact with the site. I felt that actually displaying a ticket and having an extra navigation feature provides 
            a much nicer display for my idea and concept and adds to the overall theme of my website. If future iterations I would 
            like to be able to create a ticket roll animation that displays the pages that way, as I feel it will fit well with the 
            theme of my website as well as add smoothness to the function of my site. I also would only like to incorporate the multiple 
            layered scratch feature onto my internet artwork page as I feel as though it would incorporate nicely only in that section of 
            my website.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall I am very happy with the creative design I have developed in my website and I am very happy with the overall look 
            and function of the site as well. I  can't wait to start developing all the other features I want to incorporate in future 
            versions of my site.
